# Project 1
## flightdex

### User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
As a user
I WANT a website where I can scan and look for deals for domestic flights within Australia at specific times. When user click on website then they are presented with a website that give an option for flight which includes 

-start location 
-final location 
-date to leave and return 
-economy, business class 

WHEN user inputs all data the page loads with best flights that match the requested details
THEN the user can select flights. User can sort flights listed with price slider that will limit results to a maximum amount. 
WHEN a user selects their flights 
THEN they can continue to the hotels page where they can select a hotel to stay for the duration of their stay at the destination or skip to next page
WHEN user continues to next page 
THEN they are presented with events happening while they are at the destination, THEN they can select an event they would like to do or skip to the next page. On final page user is shown all the data about their selected flights, hotel and events and a total cost. 
```
### Work Description
We used two APIâ€™s to receive the data for the website. First we used Amadeus for flight data and hotel data and Ticketmaster for local events. We also used Bulma a free CSS framework to add styling to our website.

For our project we split the project into four parts. From here we were able work on our own part of the final website.

-Writing HTML and completing styling on all pages.
-Flights API and results page to display received data.
-Hotel API and results page to display available hotels.
-Events API and results page for all events found.

Challenges we faced was working and reading our project partners code, As we are not used to reading other people's code it took a while to decipher how processes and functions were done and how and where we could implement our own code. Another challenge was working with Github branches and pulling and pushing, We had a few issues with merge conflicts and committing the correct branches we were each using.

We feel our major Success was working as a team of four individuals who are very new to the world of web development and creating a high quality functioning website.
